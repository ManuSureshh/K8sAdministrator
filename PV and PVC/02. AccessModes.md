- If we use `accessModes: ReadWriteOnce`,
  -  The volume can be mounted as read-write by only one node at a time.
  -  Used for Single-node applications or databases.

- If we use `accessModes: ReadOnlyMany`
  - The volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes simultaneously.
  - Used when sharing the data that should not be modified, such as static content.

 - If we use `accessModes: ReadWriteMany`
   - The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously.
   - Used when applications requiring concurrent read-write access from multiple nodes, like shared file systems.
