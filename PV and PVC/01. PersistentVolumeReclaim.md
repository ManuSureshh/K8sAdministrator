- If we use `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`=`Recycle`
  - The PV will be cleaned and can be used by other pods if our pod gets deleted.
    
- If we use `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`=`Retain`
  - The data inside a volume will be present even after our pod gets deleted/goes down.
  - This is like we are defining, "The data should be stored and I will use it again".

- If we use `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`=`Delete`
  -  The data and volume gets deleted once our pod goes down or deleted.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle/Retain/Delete
  capacity:

### Summary:
- `Retain` is crucial for scenarios requiring data preservation and manual intervention.
- `Delete` is commonly used for managing ephemeral data and simplifying resource management.
- `Recycle` is deprecated and generally not used in contemporary setups.
