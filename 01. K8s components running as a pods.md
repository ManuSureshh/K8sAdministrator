- As we can see, there are Master Node/Control Plane components are running as a containers/pods in our cluster.
- And the CNI and kube-proxy is also running on the Worker Nodes as well.
- But the main component which is responsible for creation and running the pod is missing. That is `kubelet`.
- The Worker Node component(`kubelet`) will be running as a service.
```
service kubelet status
```
