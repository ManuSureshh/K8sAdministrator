```
kubectl run demo --image nginx
```
- This command will fetch the nginx container image and run it as a pod.
- To check the status/details of pod, then we use these commands.
```
kubectl get pods 
```
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

- And the `curl` is used to interact with the service running inside the pod.
