## How to restore the `etcd` backup?
- While taking backup, we used port numabe `2379`. Because,
  - This is the default port for client communication with etcd.
  - It is used by the etcdctl command-line tool and other clients to interact with etcd (e.g., querying, writing data).
    
- But when we are restoring, we use the port number `2380`. Because,
  - This port is used for peer communication between etcd nodes in a cluster.
  - It allows etcd instances to communicate with each other for synchronization and replication purposes.

```
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /etcd-backup/etcd-snapshot-latest.db \
  --initial-cluster etcd-restore=https://10.128.15.217:2380 \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://10.128.15.217:2380 \
  --name etcd-restore \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd
```

**Example: -**

- Previously I had taken a backup of etcd. And I will delete the `namespace` on the cluster and will restore the backup and check.
