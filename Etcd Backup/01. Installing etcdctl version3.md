### In order to take backup of etcd, we need to have utility call called `etcdctl`
- By default k8s will provide the etcdctl of `version 2`. But we need to install `version3`
  ```
     export RELEASE="3.3.13"
  ```

  ```
     wget https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v${RELEASE}/etcd-v${RELEASE}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```

  ```
     tar xvf etcd-v${RELEASE}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```
  ```
     cd etcd-v${RELEASE}-linux-amd64
  ```
  ```
     sudo mv etcdctl /usr/local/bin
  ```

- Check the installed version
  ```
  etcdctl --version
  ```
