## We should take the backup of `etcd certificates` for the following reasons
- **`Security`:**
  - Certificates encrypt data and authenticate access.
  - Essential for secure communication and preventing unauthorized access.

- **`Consistency`:**
  - Ensures restored etcd connects properly with other components.
  - Prevents issues related to certificate mismatches.

- **`Compliance`:**
  - Adheres to industry regulations and standards.
  - Ensures secure handling and storage of credentials.

- **`Continuity`:**
  - Facilitates smooth restoration and operation.
  - Maintains security and access controls after backup restoration.

## How to check the etcd certificates path?
- On master node:
  ```
  cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
  ```
  ```
  nano etcd.yaml
  ```

```

```  
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=MasterNodeInternalIP:2379 \
--cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /etcd-backup/etcd-snapshot-latest.db
```
   
```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=10.128.15.217:2379 \
